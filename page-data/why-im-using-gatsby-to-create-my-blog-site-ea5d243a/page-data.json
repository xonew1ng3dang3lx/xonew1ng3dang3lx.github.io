With all these options, why did I pick Gatsby? The answer is simple - speed. Gatsby is a static-site generator which means the entire site is generate at build time rather than dynamically. Solutions like Wordpress are database driven, so when a person visits a site generated by Wordpress, the server will grab all the necessary data from a Database in order to generate the page. Gatsby on the other hand already generated the page before the user has visited the site.</p>\n<h2>Gatsby Uses Modern Web Tech</h2>\n<p>Gatsby uses React, Webpack, and other modern technologies out of the box. You can add plugins to support SASS, Typescript, and other modern frameworks/libraries. </p>\n<p>I've tried out other Static Site generators in the past like Jekyll and with some hacking around, you can get React to work with it, but Gatsby supports React out of the box.</p>\n<h2>Gatsby is Fast and No server costs</h2>\n<p>I'm using <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">Github Pages</a> to host my site.
