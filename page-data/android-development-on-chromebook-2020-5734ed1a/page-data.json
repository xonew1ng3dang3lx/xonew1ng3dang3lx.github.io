I tested this out on a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2DoOw6C\">HP x2 Chromebook</a>, but I would recommend a better machine. Mobile development generally requires a pretty good machine (like an <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3hU5vfY\">i5 Pixelbook Go</a>) in order to compile and build the project quickly. Check out my list of <a href=\"https://techwaifu.com/recommended-chromebooks-for-programming-2020-5734ed1a\">Best Chromebooks for Programming</a> if you're not sure which Chromebook to use. If you already have a Chromebook, make sure the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-linux\">device is compatible with Crostini</a> since this tutorial assumes you're using Crostini.</p>\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Make sure you follow the steps in <a href=\"https://techwaifu.com/ultimate-guide-coding-on-chromebook-bb405513\">Setting Up Java, Python, Node, React, and Angular on a Chromebook</a> to set up Crostini. You'll only need to follow the steps under \"Set up Linux (Crostini) on your Chromebook\". Once that's complete, come back to this tutorial.</p>\n<h2>Setting Up Android Studio</h2>\n<p>Setting up Android Studio to write native apps on a Chromebook is relatively simple, you'll just need to download Android Studio.</p>\n<h3>Download Android Studio</h3>\n<p>Get started by <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio\">downloading Android Studio</a>. You'll find the <code>.deb</code> file under your <code>Downloads</code> folder. Double click it in order to install it.</p>\n<h3>Enabling ADB</h3>\n<p>Since the Chromebook can run Android apps, you can actually build and run the Android app on the Chromebook itself. In the settings app, go to the linux section.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/mobile_dev_on_chromebook/3.png?width=2400&#x26;height=1600&#x26;isResponsive=true\" alt=\"Enabling ADB\"></p>\n<p>Click the \"Develop Android Apps\" section and toggle the feature on. You'll need to reboot the device to activate the feature.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/mobile_dev_on_chromebook/5.png?width=2400&#x26;height=1600&#x26;isResponsive=true\" alt=\"Enabling ADB\"></p>\n<h3>Verifying Android Studio is Setup Properly</h3>\n<p>After enabling ADB, you can create a sample project in Android Studio and run the app. It took almost 20 minutes for <a href=\"https://gradle.org/\">Gradle</a> to complete the very first build. I suspect this has to do with my Chromebook having 4GB of RAM. If everything is setup correctly, you'll see the Android app running like the screenshot below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/mobile_dev_on_chromebook/2.png?width=2400&#x26;height=1600&#x26;isResponsive=true\" alt=\"Android Studio with Android App\"></p>\n<p>You'll also see the Android app will appear in your App Tray.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/mobile_dev_on_chromebook/6.png?width=2400&#x26;height=1600&#x26;isResponsive=true\" alt=\"Android App in App Tray\"></p>\n<h2>Setting Up Flutter</h2>\n<p>After testing out Android Studio for native Android development, I was curious to see if you could use Flutter on a Chromebook as well and it turns out you can.\n<a href=\"https://flutter.dev/\">Flutter</a> is a framework that lets you write a mobile application once and it will generate an iOS and Android app. Flutter recently got support for Web as well, but it's still in beta. Make sure you follow the steps to set up Android Studio or else this won't work. You can find the <a href=\"https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/chromeos\">official doc for installing Flutter here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Installing the Flutter SDK</h3>\n<p>First download the Flutter SDK by clicking on this <a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra/releases/stable/linux/flutter_linux_1.20.1-stable.tar.xz\">link</a>. Make sure you move the SDK from your <code>Downloads</code> folder to your <code>Linux files</code> folder.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/mobile_dev_on_chromebook/7.png?width=2400&#x26;height=1600&#x26;isResponsive=true\" alt=\"Flutter SDK\"></p>\n<p>After you download the SDK, open up your terminal and type in the following commands. This will extract the binary.</p>\n<pre><code>mkdir development\ncd ~/development\ntar xf ~/flutter_linux_1.20.1-stable.tar.xz\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next open up your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file and add the following code to it. This will make it easier to run the <code>flutter</code> commands whenever we have a new terminal instance. If you already have a PATH export, add it to the existing PATH export.</p>\n<pre><code>export PATH=\"$PATH:`pwd`/development/flutter/bin\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>After updating the <code>~/.bashrc</code> file, make sure to run <code>source ~/.bashrc</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/mobile_dev_on_chromebook/8.png?width=2400&#x26;height=1600&#x26;isResponsive=true\" alt=\"Flutter Bashrc\"></p>\n<h3>Verifying the Flutter SDK is Installed</h3>\n<p>Run the following command to verify you installed Flutter correctly.</p>\n<pre><code>which flutter\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should see something like <code>/home/ironman/development/flutter/bin/flutter</code> printed to the terminal. If nothing is printed then you most likely made a mistake earlier.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/mobile_dev_on_chromebook/21.png?width=2400&#x26;height=1600&#x26;isResponsive=true\" alt=\"Verifying Flutter SDK\"></p>\n<h3>Downloading Development Binaries</h3>\n<p>Run the following commands to make sure we get all the requirement dependencies. Running <code>flutter doctor</code> will verify your environment and make sure you have everything needed to run Flutter properly. When you run <code>flutter doctor --android-licenses</code>, you'll need to accept a couple of licensing agreements.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/mobile_dev_on_chromebook/10.png?width=2400&#x26;height=1600&#x26;isResponsive=true\" alt=\"Verifying Flutter Doctor\"></p>\n<pre><code>flutter precache\nflutter doctor\nflutter doctor --android-licenses\n</code></pre>\n<p>After running those commands, you'll see running <code>flutter doctor</code> outputs something like the screenshot below. Don't worry if you see an exclamation mark by Android Studio.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/mobile_dev_on_chromebook/11.png?width=2400&#x26;height=1600\" alt=\"Verifying Flutter Doctor after installing dependencies\"></p>\n<p>Also make sure you have ADB setup correctly by running <code>flutter devices</code>. You'll see your device's name printed in the terminal.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/mobile_dev_on_chromebook/12.png?width=2400&#x26;height=1600&#x26;isResponsive=true\" alt=\"Flutter Devices\"></p>\n<h3>Setting Up an IDE</h3>\n<p>I presonally don't like using Android Studio since it's a memory hog so I use <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/download\">VSCode</a> instead. Make sure you download the <code>.deb</code> file instead of the <code>.rpm</code> file. After installing VSCode, install the Flutter Extension.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/mobile_dev_on_chromebook/19.png?width=2400&#x26;height=1600\" alt=\"VSCode Flutter Extension\"></p>\n<h3>Creating your First Flutter App</h3>\n<p>Flutter makes it super easy to create a new project. Just run the following command in the terminal and it'll automatically generate a new project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/mobile_dev_on_chromebook/15.png?width=2400&#x26;height=1600&#x26;isResponsive=true\" alt=\"Create Flutter Project\"></p>\n<pre><code>flutter create flutterapp\ncd flutterapp/\nflutter run\n</code></pre>\n<p>After running <code>flutter run</code>, you'll see the sample app after the project successfully builds. Unfortunately, you won't be able to test out the iOS counterpart unless you have a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CgtmHG\">Mac</a> since you need <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12\">xCode</a> which is exclusive to MacOS.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/mobile_dev_on_chromebook/17.png?width=2400&#x26;height=1600&#x26;isResponsive=true\" alt=\"Running a Flutter App\"></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>There you have it!
