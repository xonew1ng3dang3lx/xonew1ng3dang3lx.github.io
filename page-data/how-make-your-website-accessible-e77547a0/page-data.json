Add Alt Text to Every Image</h4>\n<p>Alt text is what screen readers read out when an image is tapped. This will give the user some context as to what the image is.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/accessibility/example_alt_text-low.png?width=1936&#x26;height=669&#x26;hiRes=example_alt_text.png\" alt=\"Example alt text\"></p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;img src=\"https://imgur.com/d8dzF1V\" alt=\"Picture of my 10 year old cat\" />\n</code></pre>\n<h4>2. Only One H1 tag on the Page</h4>\n<p>This is a common mistake a lot of websites have. I see a lot of people using more than one <code>&#x3C;h1></code> tag on the page. Reserve the <code>h1</code> for for titles of or main topic of the page. This <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Designing_Headings\">article</a> explains some of the common usecases for h1, h2, and h3.</p>\n<h4>3. Use semantic html tags</h4>\n<p>Another common mistake is using the wrong html tag in the wrong place. Let's look at the following example.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;button onclick=\"navigateToHome()\">Home&#x3C;/button>\n&#x3C;a href=\"/\">Home&#x3C;/a>\n</code></pre>\n<p>While these two may look and act same, this won't behave the same when using a screen reader. The screen readers will actually announce the type of element you're touching. So when you're touching a button, the screen reader will announce \"Home Button.\" Similarily, the screen reader will announce \"Home Link\" when you tap on the anchor tag. (What the voice reader announces will vary depending on the device and OS).</p>\n<h4>4. Preserve Functionality for Users Using a Keyboard</h4>\n<p>Some users do not use a mouse to navigate through your page. One way to test if all the elements on the page are reachable by a keyboard is to press the <code>tab</code> key. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/accessibility/navigation_highlight.png?width=720&#x26;height=393\" alt=\"Navigation by keyboard\"></p>\n<p>Sometimes you might want to control the sequence in which elements should be focused. This can be achieved by <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex\">tabindex</a>. <code>tabindex=-1</code> means the element cannot be reached by keyboard. A positive index means the element should be focusable in sequential keyboard navigation, with its order defined by the value of the number. For example, <code>tabindex=1</code> will be focused on before <code>tabindex=2</code>.</p>\n<h4>5. Use Aria Labels When Appropriate</h4>\n<p>There are times where you properly use semantic html tags, but you want assistive technologies to read something different. For example, a lot of websites use an \"x\" as a close button. An easy way is to use the \"x\" key.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;button onclick=\"close()\">X&#x3C;/button>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The problem with this is that the screenreader will announce \"X Button\" which would be confusing for those who can't see the page. To get around this, you can use an <code>aria-label</code> which is basically like an img's alt text.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;button aria-label=\"Close\" onclick=\"close()\">X&#x3C;/button>\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the follow up example, the screen reader will announce the button as \"Close Button\" which is much more useful than \"X Button.\"</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Hopefully you now have a better understanding why we should design for accessibility. These key takeaways will both make your site more usable for more people, but it will also help search engines understand your site better. How accessible are your products?
