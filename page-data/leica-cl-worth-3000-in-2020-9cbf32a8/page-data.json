It uses a L-mount which features autofocus unlike the conventional M-mount that most Leica cameras use. I've had many people ask me if the Leica CL is worth it in 2020, so let's take a look at how well it fairs in 2020.</p>\n<h2>Specs</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Specs</th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Max resolution</td>\n<td>6,000Ã—4,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Effective pixels</td>\n<td>24 megapixels</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sensor size</td>\n<td>APS-C</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sensor type</td>\n<td>CMOS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ISO</td>\n<td>50-50000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max shutter speed</td>\n<td>1/25000 sec - 30 sec</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weight with battery</td>\n<td>483g (1.06lb)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dimensions</td>\n<td>131 x 78 x 45 mm (5.2 x 3.1 x 1.8\")</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Year Released</td>\n<td>2017</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Build</h2>\n<p>The Leica CL has a very elegant and classic Leica look. The camera is smaller and lighter than your typical mirrorless camera at 483g (1.06lb) which makes it the ideal travel camera. While the camera is light, the camera is extremely durable. The body is made of magnesium and top and bottom plates are black anodized aluminum. The body is also wrapped in fine-grain leather. It also comes with the trademark Leica logo on the front. Design-wise, the CL is basically a mini Leica M.</p>\n<p>Both the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/32UMMwv\">Leica TL2</a> and the Leica CL share the same sensor, but have a different body. I personally prefer the look and feel of the CL over the TL2. The TL2 doesn't come with an EVF which is a biggie for me and the leather wrapping just feels nicer to hold. However, I do wish the CL came with a grip like the TL2 to make the camera easier to hold. You can purchase an optional <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WZP61x\">Leica CL Handgrip</a>, but it's pretty expensive.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<h4>Autofocus</h4>\n<p>Unlike most Leica cameras, this comes with autofocus like the SL, Q, and other T series making it easier for newcomers to pick up and use. This camera comes with a 49 point contract-detect autofocus system. It works pretty good for a camera that came out in 2017, but I found Sony's autofocus to be far superior. I found the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2D76Zod\">Sony RX100vii</a>'s eye detection to blow the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/302h1A2\">Leica CL</a> out of the water. The camera supports shooting at up to 10 frames per second. Don't expect to use this for sports photography, but it's definitely not a slow camera. Thankfully, you can also use your M lens with this camera if you pick up a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3g1Ql82\">M-Adapter T</a>. These lens will only work in manual focus, but it's a nice option you have M lens sitting around.</p>\n<h4>Controls</h4>\n<p>This Leica is unique since it comes with 2 unlabeled wheels which have different functionality based on your shooting mode. I found it difficult to remember what each dial does since it's not labeled, so I ended up just sticking to Aperture Priority.</p>\n<p>There's also a monochrome LCD that shows your shooting mode, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and exposure compensation. I honestly don't use it too often since that information is available through the viewfinder. The viewfinder is a welcome addition since the TL series require the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2OVfhSP\">Visoflex to use a EVF</a>.</p>\n<p>The camera doesn't have that many buttons in general. On the back there's a Play, Function, and Menu button. The dials can also be down on to change certain settings depending on your mode.</p>\n<h4>4K video at up to 30 frames per second</h4>\n<p>The camera supports shooting video at 4k, but I wouldn't use it for any professional shooting.</p>\n<h4>Transfer Over Wifi</h4>\n<p>The camera also comes with the ability to transfer photos over WIFI using the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/app/leica-fotos/id1356061526\">Leica Fotos app</a>. I found this too painful to use since it took a long time to transfer the RAW files. I recommend sticking to transferring via the memory card.</p>\n<h2>Images</h2>\n<p>All of these photos were shot with <a href=\"https://amzn.to/39r9YUm\">Leica Summilux TL 35mm f/1.4</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153365536_dee6178fad_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153364736_bcbd58f99f_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153600887_b94a0ae3fa_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50152814688_76eaffe71a_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50152813688_cd092adf98_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50152812678_5a0c9ec9e6_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50152811723_73d83d4957_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50152810228_2de5dda860_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153595417_a1d6a45df1_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153357566_a9797818f4_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153593982_b6cc46f0ac_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153593062_38ab01b345_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153355101_b9ea0a89ff_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153591717_92e6fd57e4_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153590842_35ba5bb14b_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50152804168_d78040749f_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153351531_900d7b93b5_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153350701_daa291a98c_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153587332_2a011bac87_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153348741_df93e6a640_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153347591_865b13918a_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153344711_3a5c5b17af_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153342421_241c9c3305_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153578907_de0c9227b9_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153340591_e29ea4ceb0_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50153580732_3be8ea6c6f_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50152797333_46832e5391_k.jpg\" alt=\"Img\"></p>\n<p>You can find all the <a href=\"https://flic.kr/s/aHsmPDfL7U\">images taken from the Leica CL here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Final Verdict</h2>\n<p>When this camera first came out, kit with the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3g5PSBG\">Leica Elmarit TL 18mm lens</a> cost around $4000. I bought this camera back in early 2019 for $3195 which came with a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3g5PSBG\">Leica Elmarit TL 18mm f/2.8</a>. You can get the same <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2D4ypLi\">bundle</a> in 2020 for $3000. I also bought the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/39r9YUm\">Leica Summilux TL 35mm f/1.4</a> which cost $2500. In total, I spent $5700 before tax. This is still cheap compared to Leica's other offerings like the M10 or the SL series, but the real question is it worth it in 2020? It depends. Like all Leica cameras, you can get a full frame camera at the same price with much better specs, a better selection of lens, and faster autofocus. You can pair the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2OVO8Pv\">Sony a7R IV</a> costs $3200 with a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CQLubf\">Zeiss Batis 2/25</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2OT8bxY\">Zeiss Batis 85mm</a> and still be under $5700. If you must buy a Leica, I would recommend the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2D9RrQi\">Leica Q2</a> over the Leica CL + Summilux in 2020 since it's about $700 cheaper. Check out my <a href=\"https://techwaifu.com/leica-q2-first-impressions-a0297887\">hands on impression of the Leica Q2</a> to learn more. However, if you demand the minimalism, a light camera, interchangeable lens, and amazing build quality, this camera is for you. Even though, it's an APS-C camera, my Leica CL outperforms my previous Sony a7ii in most situations (maybe not lowlight). The camera lens are also top notch and high quality. I do question whether Leica will continue to produce T series cameras though. I'm hoping Leica will put out a successor to the CL so I can continue to use my TL lens in the future to make my investment worth it.</p>\n<p><review></review></p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Leica CL (not to be confused with the "},{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_CL"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"1973 Leica CL"}]},{"type":"text","value":") is an APS-C camera that was released in 2017.
