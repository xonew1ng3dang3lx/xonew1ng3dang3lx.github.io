The packaging is super ecofriendly; although its a bit cheap considering the camera costs $5000. The drawer design is pretty nice, but the whole experience doesn't scream 'luxary'. The packaging doesn't come with too much either. Other than the camera, you also get a leather strap, a lens cap, a lens hood, a charger, and a single battery. At the end of the day, I think it's great that the box packaging makes it super easy to recycle and camera is what's most important anyways.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://imgur.com/1kpaOaLl.jpg\" alt=\"Leica Q2 Box\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://imgur.com/xqUyAzml.jpg\" alt=\"Leica Q2 Box\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://imgur.com/m28HDwD.jpg\" alt=\"Leica Q2 Box\"></p>\n<h3>Specs &#x26; Features</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Specs</th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Max resolution</td>\n<td>8368 x 5584</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Effective pixels</td>\n<td>47 megapixels</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sensor size</td>\n<td>Full frame (36 x 24 mm)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sensor type</td>\n<td>CMOS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ISO</td>\n<td>50-50000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Focal length</td>\n<td>28 mm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max aperture</td>\n<td>F1.7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shutter speed</td>\n<td>1/40000 sec - 2 min</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weight with battery</td>\n<td>734 g (1.62 lb / 25.89 oz)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dimensions</td>\n<td>130 x 80 x 92 mm (5.12 x 3.15 x 3.62\")</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Other key features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>f/1.7 Summilux lens</li>\n<li>3.68MP OLED EVF with 0.76x magnification</li>\n<li>4K video capture</li>\n<li>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth</li>\n</ul>\n<p><media-ads type=\"blog-content\"></media-ads></p>\n<h3>Build Quality</h3>\n<p>The build quality is no joke. The body is made of magnesium-alloy making the camera weigh 718g, but it still feels light enough to carry it around. The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2NZx1fm\">Leica Q2</a> has an IP52 rating which means some dust, sand, and light rain won't stop it from working.</p>\n<h3>Day to day handling</h3>\n<p>While the camera looks amazing in pictures, the camera can be a bit uncomfortable to hold since it doesn't come with a grip. You can optionally buy a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2OeaYlf\">Thumb Grip</a> and/or a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2O3t5Ky\">Hand Grip</a> to make the ergonomics a bit better.</p>\n<p>For better or worse, there aren't that many buttons on the Leica Q2. Personally, I'm a fan of minimalistic design so this doesn't bother me too much, but some people may miss having a bunch of custom function keys or dedicated video recording buttons if you're coming from other cameras.</p>\n<p>The camera comes with a touchscreen, but it doesn't work when you're in the settings. I never use the touchscreens on my cameras, but it's there if you need it. </p>\n<p>Another thing that you'll probably notice from day to day shooting is that the images are massive. A single RAW file is almost 85MB and a JPG file is almost 20MB. This is something to keep in mind if you don't have a high speed/high capacity memory card.</p>\n<h3>Photos</h3>\n<p>I honestly really like how the photos look out of the camera. This has not been the case with other cameras I've used like the Sony Alpha a7II, which always needed a bit of tweaking to look nice. </p>\n<p>Note: All of these photos were taken before the COVID-19.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50085296256_d888a5021f_o.jpg?width=8368&#x26;height=5584\" alt=\"Leica Q2 Sample\">\n<a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2jiSeCC\">Flickr</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50085302286_6f3cfb0323_o.jpg?width=8368&#x26;height=5584\" alt=\"Leica Q2 Sample\">\n<a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2jiShTv\">Flickr</a></p>\n<p><media-ads type=\"blog-content-2\"></media-ads></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50085307211_2ab9aed5c0_o.jpg?width=8368&#x26;height=5584\" alt=\"Leica Q2 Sample\">\n<a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2jiSgqA\">Flickr</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50084715193_fd37fd6b4f_o.jpg?width=8368&#x26;height=5584\" alt=\"Leica Q2 Sample\">\n<a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/2jiPfUi\">Flickr</a></p>\n<h3>Accessories</h3>\n<p>There aren't many accessories you can buy for the Leica Q2, but I did come across a couple of items to make the experience better.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2BJNjpZ\">Vi Vante Sheetline Black Rope Luxury Camera Neck Strap</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm honestly not a big fan of the leather strap the camera comes with, so I replaced it with this one.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3f7kEtk\">Leica T-System case</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This bag is nice and compact.
