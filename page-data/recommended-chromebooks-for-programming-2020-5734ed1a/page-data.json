With so many laptops and ChromeOS devices on the market today, purchasing a laptop is always a difficult process.

Having a decent CPU, a minimum of 8GB of RAM, and a good amount of disk space are essential for a programming laptop. Most Chromebooks come with a Core m3 which is designed for fanless systems and can get throttled under high load. Unfortunately majority of Chromebooks don't have any fans so expect a bit of throttling if you go with a fanless system. Also, expect these devices to be more expensive than your typical Chromebook due to the higher specs. </p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2DLzVSL\">Acer Chromebook Spin 713</a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/recommended_chromebooks/acer_chromebook_spin.jpg?width=960&#x26;height=631\" alt=\"Acer Chromebook Spin 713\"></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Specs</th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Screen Size</td>\n<td>13.5 inch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resolution</td>\n<td>2k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weight</td>\n<td>3.5lb</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CPU</td>\n<td>i5-10210U</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RAM</td>\n<td>8GB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Storage</td>\n<td>128GB SSD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Battery</td>\n<td>Avg 9 Hours battery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Price</td>\n<td>$629</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A bright screen that exceeds 400 nits?
