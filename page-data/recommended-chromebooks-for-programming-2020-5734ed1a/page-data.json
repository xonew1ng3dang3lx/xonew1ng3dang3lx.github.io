With so many laptops and ChromeOS devices on the market today, purchasing a laptop is always a difficult process. Luckily for you, I've compiled a list of the best Chromebooks for your programming needs.</p>\n<p>The requirements for a good programming device is the same regardless of the OS. Having a decent CPU, a minimum of 8GB of RAM, and a good amount of disk space are essential for a programming laptop. Most Chromebooks come with a Core m3 which is designed for fanless systems and can get throttled under high load. Unfortunately majority of Chromebooks don't have any fans so expect a bit of throttling if you go with a fanless system. Also, expect these devices to be more expensive than your typical Chromebook due to the higher specs. </p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2DLzVSL\">Acer Chromebook Spin 713</a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/recommended_chromebooks/acer_chromebook_spin.jpg?width=960&#x26;height=631&#x26;isResponsive=true&#x26;supportsWebp=true\" alt=\"Acer Chromebook Spin 713\"></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Specs</th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Screen Size</td>\n<td>13.5 inch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resolution</td>\n<td>2k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weight</td>\n<td>3.5lb</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CPU</td>\n<td>i5-10210U</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RAM</td>\n<td>8GB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Storage</td>\n<td>128GB SSD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Battery</td>\n<td>Avg 9 Hours battery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Price</td>\n<td>$629</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A bright screen that exceeds 400 nits? Check. Core i5 processor? Check. Aluminum chassis? Check. This laptop checks all the essentials for a good laptop. It's also competitively priced at $629, but you can find it on sale for $529. It also has a 3:2 aspect ratio which is pretty nice. This laptop also contains fans unlike The Galaxy Chromebook and Pixelbook Go which helps cool the laptop for compiling those large projects. Honestly, this laptop is this best bang for the buck.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://amzn.to/31oZUrn\">Pixelbook Go</a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/recommended_chromebooks/pixelbook_go.jpg?width=960&#x26;height=530&#x26;isResponsive=true&#x26;supportsWebp=true\" alt=\"Pixelbook Go\"></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Specs</th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Screen Size</td>\n<td>13 inch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resolution</td>\n<td>1080p</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weight</td>\n<td>2.3lb</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CPU</td>\n<td>i5- 8200Y</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RAM</td>\n<td>8GB - 16GB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Storage</td>\n<td>128GB SSD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Battery</td>\n<td>Avg 12 Hours battery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Price</td>\n<td>$799</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I like the Pixelbook Go because of the modern design with great battery performance. The keyboard is great to type on unlike thinner laptops like the original Pixelbook. 1080p is a bit underwhelming, but that's how it's able to maintain battery at 12 hours. It's also cheaper than the other options starting at $800 for the core i5 model.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://amzn.to/33wHF68\">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook</a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/recommended_chromebooks/galaxy_chromebook.jpg?width=960&#x26;height=772&#x26;isResponsive=true&#x26;supportsWebp=true\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Chromebook\"></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Specs</th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Screen Size</td>\n<td>AMOLED 13.3 inch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resolution</td>\n<td>4k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weight</td>\n<td>2.4lbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CPU</td>\n<td>i5-10210U</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RAM</td>\n<td>8GB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Storage</td>\n<td>256GB SSD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Battery</td>\n<td>Avg 5 Hours battery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Price</td>\n<td>$999</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This laptop is the spiritual successor to the original Google Pixelbook. It sports the same design, with an improved display. The 4k AMOLED panel is what you would expect from a Samsung device. The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook has a built-in media reader for microSD and UFS memory cards and a 360 flip and fold design. This laptop also comes with a stylus, but most Chromebook apps and Android apps have limited support for styluses. Unfortunately, the laptop also has meager battery life and overheating issues which holds it back from being the perfect Chromebook.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Xx5ZAP\">Lenovo Yoga C630 Chromebook</a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/recommended_chromebooks/lenovo_yoga.jpg?width=960&#x26;height=544&#x26;isResponsive=true&#x26;supportsWebp=true\" alt=\"Lenovo Yoga C630 Chromebook\"></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Specs</th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Screen Size</td>\n<td>15.6 inch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resolution</td>\n<td>4k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weight</td>\n<td>4.2lbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CPU</td>\n<td>i5-8250U</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RAM</td>\n<td>8GB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Storage</td>\n<td>128GB SSD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Battery</td>\n<td>Avg 6.5 Hours battery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Price</td>\n<td>$769</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This laptop is at the bottom of the list due to being one of the older devices. It's also heavier than the rest of the options and doesn't have the most amazing battery, but it does sport a 4k display. It sports a the iconic Lenovo design if that's what you like. For $30 more you can purchase a Pixelbook Go which has twice the battery life.</p>\n<h2>Accessories for your Chromebook</h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2PyHvmw\">Laptop Sleeve Case</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/recommended_chromebooks/laptop_sleeve.jpg?width=1498&#x26;height=1298&#x26;isResponsive=true&#x26;supportsWebp=true\" alt=\"Laptop Sleeve Case\"></p>\n<p>I have been using this laptop sleeve for my iPad and Chromebooks. It says it's for a Macbook, but it's compatible with any device as long as the dimensions match.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3agbtW4\">Aukey USB C Hub</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/recommended_chromebooks/usb_hub.jpg?width=1469&#x26;height=1500&#x26;isResponsive=true&#x26;supportsWebp=true\" alt=\"Aukey USB C Hub\"></p>\n<p>This dock will cover all your needs. It comes with 2 HDMI ports, a memory card reader, 2 USB A 3.0 ports, 2 USB A 2.0 ports, and a charging port.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3kufWZJ\">Xbox One Controller</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/recommended_chromebooks/controller.jpg?width=1239&#x26;height=900&#x26;isResponsive=true\" alt=\"Xbox One Controller\"></p>\n<p>Did you know you can game on a Chromebook with Stadia? I've tested it out with my <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3kt5OjR\">HP Chromebook x2</a> and it works flawlessly. You can also pair this controller to your Chromebook to play Android games that are compatible with an external controller.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CeLyS0\">Logitech MX Ergo Wireless Mouse</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/recommended_chromebooks/mouse.jpg?width=1257&#x26;height=943&#x26;isResponsive=true\" alt=\"Logitech MX Ergo Wireless Mouse\"></p>\n<p>This is the primary mouse I use when I'm coding. It's a bit expensive compared to <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2F9ir3L\">Logitech M570</a>, but having bluetooth and an internal battery is so convenient. The MX has a better built quality compared to the M570.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3a7683j\">Dell 32 Inch LED Curved QHD Monitor</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/recommended_chromebooks/monitor.jpg?width=1257&#x26;height=943&#x26;isResponsive=true&#x26;supportsWebp=true\" alt=\"Dell 32 Inch LED Curved QHD Monitor\"></p>\n<p>Even though Chromebooks don't have that much graphics power, they can still power a high resolution monitor. I've tested my Pixelbook with this 32 inch monitor and my <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XFetWY\">Dell UltraSharp U3415W</a> and it works perfectly fine with a dongle.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Chromebooks are a great alternative to using a Windows laptop or a Macbook. Chromebooks with Crostini makes it much easier for programmers to install linux on their device and fulfill their programming needs.
