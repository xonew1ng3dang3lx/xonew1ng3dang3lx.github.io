Most PC gaming setups have a dark edgy ‘macho’ vibe, so if you're the opposite and want a setup that matches your soft and girly aesthetics, below are seven things I'd recommend to get started.</p>\n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/38pC6H2\">Quartz Razer Keyboard</a></h3>\n<p>When looking for a gaming keyboard, you’ll want to keep in mind what switches it uses. The Quartz Razer keyboard is a mechanical keyboard, so the keys are louder and more robust. Just a personal preference, but I enjoy when my keys feel more clicky and responsive. Another positive aspect is that the keys are raised a bit up so it’s easy to clean. You can  customize the lighting for each key to your liking and it also includes a removable wrist rest that makes typing comfortable. I’ve played long hours on Overwatch and Monster hunter on this keyboard and I have no complaints. </p>\n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2EtjRWe\">Razer D.Va MEKA Headset</a></h3>\n<p>If you’re a big fan of D.va from Overwatch then this iconic headset is a must have. It is a perfect replica and makes you feel you are cosplaying her character while playing. The headset is quite sturdy and the pink color is very vibrant. The material is a mixture of silicone and plastic so quality is pretty impressive.  It has nice leatherette cushions for your ears for comfort, but I would say the cushions are relatively small which may cause people who wear glasses some degree of pressure on their ears if they play for longer hours. The cables are not detachable and are wired to the headphones. The mic itself is not too bad for the price, but be aware that it does pick up a lot of background noises.</p>\n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dZ0q3u\">Razer Basilisk mouse</a></h3>\n<p>Absolutely love this mouse! This is the first gamer mouse I've used and I was surprised at how smooth it was. I have small hands but I have a good grip of the mouse so it always feels comfortable. I’ll be honest and say the pink color was the main reason why I bought it but I’m happy the quality has been amazing. Not only does it feel more luxurious than cheap, it is also fully customizable from DPI settings and lets me match the glow of my keyboard making my setup 100x slicker. </p>\n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3hmrjB2\">Rose Gold Headset Stand</a></h3>\n<p>Simple headphone stand for your headphones. No complaints about this product as it does its job nicely and was easy to assemble. The base is sturdy and doesn’t tip over when I place my headphone on it.</p>\n<h3>5. Samsung 351 Series S32F351</h3>\n<p>Big white monitor to compliment your gaming needs. It is lightweight,  good build quality, and worth it for a simple setup. Although the screen resolution is not the greatest, the games still look decent and have high contrast. You can easily adjust the brightness and contrast of your screen. Since this monitor is no longer on the market, I would recommend to friends the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CarEa8\">Samsung 32 inch CF391 Curved Monitor</a> which is also a good monitor for a new simple PC build. </p>\n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2NWByPq\">Pioneer Pro DJ DM-40-W</a></h3>\n<p>These speakers have not let me down. For great quality, this is an excellent cheaper alternative to studio speakers. I recommend using them as computer desktop speakers. They are amazing while you game or work.</p>\n<h3>7. LINNMON / ALEX</h3>\n<p>Most importantly, no gaming setup is complete without a white desk. You’re welcome to purchase any desk of your choice. For me, I like my desk to be as simple as possible. This desk from IKEA does a good job achieving the minimalist look with a good spacious size to still be useful. </p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2NWByPq\">Pioneer Pro DJ DM-40-W</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3hmrjB2\">Rose Gold Headset Stand</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3dZ0q3u\">Razer Basilisk mouse</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2EtjRWe\">Razer D.Va MEKA Headset</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/38pC6H2\">Quartz Razer Keyboard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2CarEa8\">Samsung 32 inch CF391 Curved Monitor</a></li>\n</ul>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Whether you want to start your twitch streaming career or you want to build a nice set up for your gaming sessions, there are many options for gamers of every level.
